1,Concept,Advanced,"Why is the electric field due to an induced dipole multiplied by a factor of 1/2 in the potential energy?","Because the dipole moment is induced, not constant; it increases from zero as the field is applied, analogous to elastic potential energy."
1,Concept,Advanced,"What is the van der Waals potential energy proportional to?","It is proportional to r⁻⁶."
1,Concept,Advanced,"Describe the difference between microscopic and macroscopic fields.","Macroscopic fields are spatial and temporal averages of microscopic fields, which fluctuate on atomic scales."
1,Concept,Advanced,"Explain how the macroscopic fields relate to Maxwell’s equations.","Macroscopic fields satisfy averaged Maxwell's equations identical in form to microscopic ones because of their linearity."
1,Concept,Advanced,"What is the significance of the self-force in classical electrodynamics?","The self-force, theoretically infinite for a point charge, is typically excluded by treating charges as having finite size or via renormalization in quantum theory."
1,Concept,Advanced,"Explain briefly the origin and behavior of the van der Waals force.","An instantaneous dipole in one atom induces a dipole in a neighboring atom, leading to an attractive interaction energy proportional to r⁻⁶."
1,Concept,Advanced,"Why can't the electric displacement vector D be considered just the field from free charges?","Because D is also affected by induced polarization in the medium, and the relation involves non-trivial constitutive equations."
